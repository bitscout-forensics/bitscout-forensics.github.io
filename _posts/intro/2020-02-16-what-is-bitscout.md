# Bitscout promise #  
Bitscout will remain transparent and open-source project with architecture focused on protecting the interests of subject system owner during remote cyber investigations. First of all, we follow the Hypocratic Oath ("First do no harm") along the development of all features. This shows our care for the subject system owner by preventing accidental harm. Second, we follow best practice of digital forensics by creating zero footprint environment that cannot change the evidence data. Last but not the least we record all actions and conversations during remote examination to be used as proof in the chain of custody.


# Is it your silver bullet? #  
This project was created by security researchers for cyber investigators and malware hunters. Although, we love to automate things and save our time through scripting, if you are looking for one click shiny solution that does routinous task over and over again, Bitscout may not suit your needs. Bitscout is a toolkit for non-standard in-depth investigations, based on deep field experience accumulated over years of investigations.

Do not expect fancy GUI in Bitscout, so if you are not familiar with Linux commandline, it's good time to learn it first. And believe us, once you down on that path you will find how much you had missed.
