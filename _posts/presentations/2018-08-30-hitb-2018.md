## Presentation: "Brain Surgery: Breaking Full Disk Encryption" ##  
Speakers: Vitaly Kamluk, Nicolas Collery  
### ABSTRACT ###  
Full Disk Encryption (FDE) may be rather useful as a defense mechanism against potential theft of a computer system. However, when the system is compromised and requires careful forensic analysis, FDE can be quite painful to forensic analysts. Unless you deal with standard and widely supported encryption such as LUKS, Bitlocker, TrueCrypt or few others, it might really hard to get through the layers of crypto code in proprietary software.

This presentation will attempt to solve this by introducing a way to break into live running custom FDE setup remotely.
